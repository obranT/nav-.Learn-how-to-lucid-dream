    <h3>Three simple methods for lucid dreams<h3>
     <h6>Dream recall<h6>
       <!--add link to stages of sleep page-->
     <p>Each night we go through <a>the stages of sleep<a> and we may or may not remember our dreams, sometimes I wake up and recall a long sequence of dreams and other times I remember nothing. This can be a problem because if we can't remember a lucid dream, well then it is as if it never happened.
       There are three ways we can deal with this problem:
     <ul>
       <li>When you wake up, train yourself to not move. Movement distracts and wakes up the mind, making it hard to recall dreams</li>
       <li>Start a dream journal. Make a habit to write down dreams as soon as you remember them, this may be in the morning or even in the middle of the night, or after a nap.</li>
       <li>Fall asleep consciously, this is the hardest method but also the most powerful. Try to watch your body as it relaxes and falls asleep, this extra attention can transfer into your dreams or you may actually be able to maintain this consciousness directly into sleep. If you can pull this off, you may have an <b>astral projection</b>.</li>
     </ul>
