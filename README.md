    <h4>Three simple methods for lucid dreams<h4>
  </header>
     <h1>Dream recall<h1>

     <p>Each night we go through <a>the stages of sleep<a> and we may or may not remember our dreams, sometimes I wake up and recall a long sequence of dreams and other times I remember nothing. This can be a problem because if we can't remember a lucid dream, well then, it is as if it never happened.<br>
       There are three ways we can deal with this problem:
     <ul>
       <li>When you wake up, train yourself to not move. Movement distracts and wakes up the mind, making it hard to recall dreams</li>
       <li>Start a dream journal. Make a habit to write down dreams as soon as you remember them, this may be in the morning or even in the middle of the night, or after a nap.</li>
       <li>Fall asleep consciously, this is the hardest method but also the most powerful. Try to watch your body as it relaxes and falls asleep, this extra attention can transfer into your dreams or you may actually be able to maintain this consciousness directly into sleep. If you can pull this off, you may have an <b>astral projection</b>.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>(If you still have trouble with dream recall, try setting an alarm a few hours before you want to wake up, use this as a dream recall alarm which should wake you from REM sleep, making it easier to recall dreams.)</p>
        </p>
<h1>Reality checks<h1>

<p>Reality checks are simple checks to see if you are dreaming or awake, in dreams there are no rules, we can fly or pass through solid matter. We use this to our advantage by 'testing' reality throughout the day, this habit will eventually come up in dreams and will help us become <em>lucid</em>.<br> Some easy reality tests include:
  <ul>
       <li>Jump! In dreams there is no gravity, so many times, if you jump, you will not come back down or you may just float there.</li>
       <li>Look at a clock or writing. Matter in dreams is always changing, so small things like letters or objects can change, distort or even disappear as you look at them or look away and look back at them.</li>
       <li>Lights. If you see a light, try to turn it on or off, in dreams it will usually have interesting results.</li>
  </ul></p>
  <h1>Make a plan</h1>
  <p>Think about what you would like to do in your next lucid dream, you could fly around and enjoy the scenery, speak to dream characters, practice a skill, or you could just pay attention to the dream and see what happens. Making this sort of plan can motivate you and help you stay lucid and centered in your next lucid dream, this is important because we can fall back into unconscious dreaming quite easily in a <abbr title="lucid dream">ld</abbr>. There are many distractions like false awakenings, social situations, habits, emotions, these can all distract us and make us forget we are dreaming. <br><br>
    
In my first <abbr title="lucid dream">ld</abbr>, a dream character tried to convince me that I wasn't dreaming, it was very strange, but after arguing with him, I payed close attention to the details. I noticed that half of the place was bathed in sunshine and the other was dark and moonlit. This was the beginning of my obsession with lucid dreams, since then I have had many lucid dreams and astral projections. I hope this guide will help you have your first lucid dream.</p>
